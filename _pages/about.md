Iâ€™m an Adjunct Instructor in the Computer Science department here at Southern New Hampshire
University.

Previously, I was a Senior Lecturer at Dartmouth College for 16 years, and an IBM Researcher working
in software, networking, security, and privacy for 39 years.

Favorite quote:

I'm married to [Elaine R. Palmer](https://research.ibm.com/people/elaine-palmer), a remarkable security nerd also at [IBM Research](http://www.research.ibm.com). We have three sons aged 23, 20, and 20, and two looney Labradoodles.

My outside hobbies include amateur [astronomy/astrophotography][PPMO], competitive marksmanship, and my family.
