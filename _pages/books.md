> What an astonishing thing a book is. It's a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on
> which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you're inside the mind
> of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is
> speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest
> of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant
> epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working
> magic.
