Left Dartmouth after 16 years and moved to southeastern NH - Beautiful! Close to Boston, Portsmouth,
and some of the nicest people we've ever met. The dogs are adjusted and the house mods are complete.
Now if I can just figure out a way to avoid an allergy incident everytime I mow the 4 acres of grass.

First time teaching at SNHU in Fall 2025! Looking forward to meeting everyone for an exciting Full Stack course!
