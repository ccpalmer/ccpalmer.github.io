Telecommunications, commerce, medical systems, transportation, energy production and distribution, government, and operation and management of critical infrastructures are a few examples where lives and livelihoods depend on the reliable operation of software. For something so vital to everyday lives around the world, software is often fragile, resulting in unexpected results or complete failures. This also makes software a target of those hoping to capitalize on this fragility for criminal activities, influence or notoriety, or disruption. This course will explore modern techniques for building software systems that are reliable, resilient, and secure. The primary topics will include the Rust programming language along with software build systems and the DevOps methodologies.</p> <p>Course first offered at Dartmouth College in Spring 2025.</p> </body></html>
